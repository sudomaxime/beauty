**In development !**

# When the framework is just right
When you get tired of trying out the cool kids stuff, or when you finally get past your inferiority complex - you'll end up here, so welcome and take a seat. Beauty is a simple and truly light scaffold to get started for making database backed applications with Python. The app is engineered to run on distributed architectures using Docker, and is truly a breeze to deploy and scale.

### Key points
* Zero configuration to get started.
* Amazing for small projects and MVPs.
* Doesn't assume you are trying to build a Facebook clone from the get go.
* Easy to learn, easy to teach and fun to maintain.
* Backed by angry engineers.

### Starting the project
Clone or pull this repo onto your machine, make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. Make sure you create your .env file, for local development you can simply use the defaults inside `.env.example`. Run `docker-compose build` and you are ready to roll with `docker-compose up`.

You can also conveniently run your tests using the command `docker exec flask make test`.

Enjoy !
